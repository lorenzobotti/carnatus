# carnatus

A tiny chess engine in Go (sunfish port). I tried to keep it minimal, but readable.

More information about how it works can be found here: https://zserge.com/posts/carnatus/

The name comes from Sebastes Carnatus, also known as Gopher Rockfish (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_rockfish)
